			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>The purpose of this website is to be an online cookbook for recipes that I learn and like! These recipes range from desserts to dinner foods to party foods.</h3>
			<p>My purpose is to have a lasting repository with recipes that are fun and simple to make, and taste good! I also appreciate the flexibility a digital cookbook offers in tweaking recipes regularly..</p>
			

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My cookbook is for people who want a simple recipe that tastes good for common and enjoyable foods. This includes college students on a budget, families with lots of mouths to feed, or anyone else!</p>
			

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>A dynamic element I want to incorporate is being able to filter or search by food type, such as breakfast, lunch, dessert, and so forth. I also want to add a servings adjuster so people cook according to however many servings they want.</p>
